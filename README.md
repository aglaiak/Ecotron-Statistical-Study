Evaluating the Impact of Climate Change on Pear Fruit Quality Using Ecotron Simulations of 2050 Conditions

**Background**: Climate change is directly impacting global food productivity. This
highlights the urgent need to better understand how ecosystems respond to these
changes and to assess the role they can play in mitigating and preventing further dis-
ruptions and their effects.
**Objectives**: This report aims to assess the effect of climate change interventions (CO2
removal, sustainable energy production, and transportation improvements) on pear
fruit quality, pear size and soil feature dynamics by using Ecotrons.
Methodology: Statistical analysis were conducted using linear and generalized mixed
effects models as well as generalized estimating equations to determine the most effec-
tive intervention on the pear quality.
**Results**: The findings suggest that climate interventions, with the main focus on ac-
tively removing CO2 and sustainable energy, have a significant impact on the pear
quality score and lead to a decrease in pear size.
Conclusions: An improvement in pear quality scores was observed in the Conference
species, where CO2 removal and sustainability measures outperformed climate condi-
tions without intervention, particularly in association with specific soil trends.
